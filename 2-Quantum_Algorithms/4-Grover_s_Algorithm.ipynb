    "For a 3-bit system, we can create eight different black boxes, each returning 1 for a different\n",
    "combination of bits. If you were given one such a black box without being informed which one, how many times do you need to run that black box (with different combinations of inputs) to find out which one was given? On average, you will need to run four times. In the worst case, it will be seven. A classical black box takes $n$-bits as input and returns 1 only for one of the possible$2^n$ inputs and returns 0 for all the remaining inputs. We don't know for which combination it returns 1. In the worst case we might have to execute the black box $2^n$ times. If we randomly choose the combination, and if we are lucky we may find it in the first iteration itself; and if we are unlucky we may have to run it for all possible combinations ($2^n$). On average it might take about $\\frac{2^n}{2}$ times. As the input size increases, the number of iterations increases by $\\mathcal{O}(2^n)$.\n",
